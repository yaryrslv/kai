"""
PR review agent - one-shot Claude subprocess for automated code review.

Provides functionality to:
1. Fetch PR diffs and metadata via the GitHub CLI
2. Construct XML-delimited review prompts (prompt injection prevention)
3. Resolve and load spec files for compliance checking
4. Spawn a one-shot Claude subprocess in --print mode for review
5. Post review output as a GitHub PR comment via gh CLI
6. Send review summaries to Telegram via the send-message API
7. Orchestrate the full pipeline from webhook event to posted review
8. Incorporate prior review comments to avoid re-flagging dismissed issues

The review agent stores no persistent state, but reads prior GitHub PR
comments for conversational awareness within a single PR. Each review is
a fresh Claude invocation with the full diff and any prior review thread
in context, so issues that were already raised and dismissed are not
repeated. If the relevant code has materially changed, the agent may
re-evaluate a prior finding.

The Claude subprocess runs in --print mode (non-interactive, no tools, no
streaming). The prompt goes in via stdin to handle large diffs without
hitting shell argument length limits. Output is captured as plain text.
