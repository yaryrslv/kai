"""
TOTP verification and rate-limiting for Kai session authentication.

The TOTP secret and attempt state live in root-owned files under /etc/kai/.
The bot accesses them via sudoers-authorized `sudo cat` and `sudo tee` calls.
This means the kai user (and any subprocess it spawns, including inner Claude)
cannot directly read or tamper with either file.

Rate limiting state is persisted to disk so lockouts survive bot restarts.

CLI usage (run as root or with sudo):
    python -m kai totp setup    # generate secret, show QR, confirm
    python -m kai totp status   # check whether TOTP is configured
    python -m kai totp reset    # remove secret and attempts files
