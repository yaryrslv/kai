"""
Webhook HTTP server for receiving external notifications, scheduling jobs, and
optionally serving as the Telegram update transport.

Provides functionality to:
1. Receive Telegram updates via webhook (when TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL is configured)
2. Receive and validate GitHub webhook events (push, PR, issues, comments, reviews)
3. Accept generic webhook notifications from any source
4. Expose a scheduling API for creating cron-style jobs via HTTP
5. Expose a jobs query API for listing and fetching scheduled jobs
6. Proxy authenticated requests to external services (service layer)
7. Send text messages and files to the Telegram chat (messaging APIs)
8. Monitor webhook health and auto-recover from Telegram delivery failures

The server always runs on aiohttp alongside the Telegram bot in the same event
loop, regardless of transport mode. In polling mode, Telegram updates arrive via
the Updater in main.py; this server still handles everything else.

Routes are organized into these groups:
    - /webhook/telegram     - Telegram updates (webhook mode only, secret_token auth)
    - /webhook/github       - GitHub events with HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
    - /webhook              - Generic webhooks with shared-secret auth
    - /api/schedule         - Job creation API (used by inner Claude via curl)
    - /api/jobs             - Job listing and detail API
    - /api/jobs/{id}        - Job detail (GET), deletion (DELETE), and update (PATCH)
    - /api/services/{name}  - External service proxy (injects auth from .env)
    - /api/send-message     - Send a text message to the Telegram chat
    - /api/send-file        - Send a file from the filesystem to the Telegram chat

The Telegram webhook route uses its own secret (TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET) and is
only registered in webhook mode. All other webhook/API endpoints require
WEBHOOK_SECRET. When WEBHOOK_SECRET is unset, only /health is active (plus
/webhook/telegram if in webhook mode).

GitHub events are formatted into human-readable Markdown messages and sent
to the configured Telegram chat. The formatter pattern (dispatch dict mapping
event type to formatter function) makes it easy to add new event types.
